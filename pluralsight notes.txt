ASP .NET Core
    - it is a new cross platform framework that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, 
    - it has fewer features than the full .net 4.6 framework
    - one reason you may not want to use .netcore is because you need a feature that .net 4.5 or 4.6 provides
    - there should be more features in the future

Features:
    - watches the file system
        - if you add or remvoe a file outside of VS, 
        it is automatically reflected in File Explorer and VS
        - if you change a web page while VS is running and refresh your browser, 
        the changed page automatically reflects changes made outside of VS
        - you do not need to explicitly build the code in VS
        - as long as the project is running without debugging, you can edit your files anywhere,
        refresh, and see the reflected changes in the browser
    - project.json
        - can manage your dependencies through dependencies section in project.json
        - interacts directly with nuget 
    - wwwroot 
        - from a hosting perspective this is the root of the website
        - static file that you want to serve over HTTP (image, stylesheets, and javascript)
        by default, you will want to place those here to make them available
    - Startup.cs
        - a lot of the configuration and startup code is placed here
        - ASP.NET will look for this file by convention
        - Configure Method
            -  used to configure the project at runtime
        - Configure Services
            - this is the place to setup inversion of control for your application
    - web.config
        - this file no longer is used by ASP .NET to determine configurations for your project
        - this file only lets IIS know how to route requests
        - all application settings should be in appsettings.json
